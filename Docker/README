This Docker configuration can be used to quickly get a development environment up and running.

Suggested commands to run:

~~~
docker build -t winstream .

docker run -d -p 8088:80 -v "C:/inetpub/wwwroot/WInStreamLegacy/CMS/:/var/www/app" winstream
~~~
Replace `C:/inetpub/wwwroot/WInStreamLegacy/CMS` with the path to the code on the host machine

You should then be able to access the website from http://localhost:8080
