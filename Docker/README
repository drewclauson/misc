This Docker configuration can be used to quickly get a development environment up and running.

Suggested commands to run:

~~~
docker build -t my_app .

docker run -d -p 8088:80 -v "C:/inetpub/wwwroot/my_app:/var/www/app" my_app
~~~
Replace `C:/inetpub/wwwroot/my_app` with the path to the code on the host machine

You should then be able to access the website from http://localhost:8080
